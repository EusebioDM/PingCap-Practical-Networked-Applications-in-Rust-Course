# Ping Cap Rust Course
This is my work in progress solution for the [Distributed Systems in Rust Ping Cap Course](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan)

## Progress 
The course is divided into 5 incremental projects. My progress so far is the following:

- [x] Project 1
- [x] Project 2
- [ ] Project 3
- [ ] Project 4
- [ ] Project 5

## Possible Improvements 
 - Change Error handling to allow errors to automatically display correctly in the CLI .
 - Only append to index instead of re-writing whole file when adding new keys
 - Check usage of String vs &str. There could be unnecessary coping.
